# Dashboard Packages

LogicMonitor dashboards provisioned with all new LogicMonitor accounts, packaged as single file download.

These dashboards depend on the presence of the latest versions of LogicMonitor datasources, and dynamic groups in the 'Devices by Type' device group. If these groups don't exist, they can be created using the out-of-box PropertySources from LogicMonitor together with the below documentation. [So make sure you have the latest PropertySources (and DataSources) from the repository!](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/settings/logicmodules/keeping-your-datasources-up-to-date/)

To see a preview of what some of these dashboards look like, visit the [LogicMonitor Dashboard Gallery](https://www.logicmonitor.com/sales/dashboards/).
